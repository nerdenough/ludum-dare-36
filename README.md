# Ludum Dare 36
This game is our entry for the 36th Ludum Dare jam!

## Story & Goal
The theme of this Ludum Dare was "Ancient Technology", so we came up with the
idea of an enchanted artifact/rune that is terrorising the land around it. The
artifact can only be deactivated by reaching the top of the tower and pressing
(colliding with) the activator.
